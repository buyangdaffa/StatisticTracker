# My Personal Project
My project for CPSC210 is to develop an application for soccer coaches to track their players' statistics throughout the season. In this application, the coaches can add and update their player profiles, where each player will have several key metrics as their parameters, such as goals, assists, starting XI, substitutions, yellow cards, red cards, etc. The primary users of this application will be soccer coaches since I hope that this application can simplify data collection and visualization for coaches who don't have a computer science or statistics background, making it easier for them to make informed decisions.

I am particularly interested in this project because I am a big soccer fan and also previously worked as a Data Analyst Intern, where I was responsible for gathering statistics data and visualizing it for the coaches. By starting a project like this, I plan to build the application further even after the CPSC 210 course ends since I believe it will be an additional portfolio for me as an aspiring data analyst in the sports industry.‚Å§
